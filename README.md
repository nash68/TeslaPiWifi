Tesla Sentinel Storage over Wifi

Ever wanted a simple way to download your video from your Tesla ?
Here is a cool solution ; a wifi SD Card powered by a small RaspberryPi Zero W !

Plug the usb cable on your Tesla. Your car will reconize it as a classic USB drive to store its camera files.
On the other side, connect the Pi to your wifi network, and use WinsSCP (https://winscp.net/) to securely transfert files.
